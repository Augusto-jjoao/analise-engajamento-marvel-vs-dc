They teach humans how to progress, they teach humans how to build, they teach humans how to protect themselves, they teach human to be human, and most importantly they taught us how to love. This movie might not have the same action as the other marvel films but all I could say that this one really hits hard from a very wide array of perception. Imagine the pain they felt when Thanos almost wiped the whole humanity the Eternals loved the most. They were like parents who can only do is to watch their successful grownup sons and daughters suffer pain and lost as they grow. The messege of the film hides beyond the essence of love for humanity, in which we all knew why Marvel was made by Stan♥️",

Literally when this trailer was shown in that room, the chairs always moved along with the beat of \"Like a Prayer\". I knew that meant it was going to be a great time for the movie. And that opening of the movie made it awesome too. This was probably the best 4DX experience I ever had in all of the 7 years I have been going to it.

Venom originally wanted to kill Spiderman and destroy everything he loved. That's all Venom wanted. Eventually in his time fighting, Venom started to simply stray away from being like a villain to stay alive which led to less killing and more \"protecting\" others. Between these two Venom movies, they basically nail that plot perfectly, while giving it a more fun and modern action packed style. Venom was never really considered a true villain, nor a hero. Venom is just Venom.\n\n(Aka yes, sort of an anti-hero). He tries to do right for his own sake, but sometimes it doesn't end up as it should",

It is as if DC has turned the page to the next chapter in the history of DC movies. Thought the new faces in the squad would make us forget about the old ones. but do not fear. The movie truly makes up for it. This movie undoubtedly has proven to us that the DC universe doesn't always have to follow the dark theme. If DC keeps up the good work and actually delivers us some actual decent DC movies like it used to. The DC universe won't just survive, but it will thrive. I do recommend watching the movie.",

Batman is dark, Wonder Woman is graceful, Aquaman is badass, Flash is impulsive, Superman is optimistic, and Shazam is childish.\n..Since a lot of y'all been asking for Black Adam, first of all Black Adam ain't a superhero. According to the live-action movie, he's an Anti-hero.  Born as a slave since 2000BC, witnessed violence & death on a regular basis so of course he won't feel remorse for the villains he has to kill.  So...Black Adam is a ruthless OG!!",

On the other hand, the second Barry Allen (Has no powers) is more confident because his mom didn't died and has a normal life. But he has no powers, so he became more of your typical college student.\n\nI can see the first Barry Allen the introvert, and the second as the extrovert. It's a funny detail if you asked me.",
